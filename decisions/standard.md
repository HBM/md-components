# JavaScript standard style

Throughout all our JavaScript code we are using [JavaScript Standard Style](http://standardjs.com/).

We started with [JSHint](http://jshint.com/), even considered [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) at some time (though never really used it in production), worked with plain [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) and finally settled with standard. It's just awesome, catches a lot of bugs and makes writing JavaScript fun.
